Tien Nguyen:
  Completed ls.c and file redirection. Helped figure out to handle commands with one argument.

Sandy Llapa:
  completed wc.c , pipes, main, unix shell implementation, helped fixed redirection, and handled commands that combined both pipes and redirection. Also made sure the right commands were called for each input. 



How to compile the program:
When in the template folder in the terminal, write "make" and hit enter, then enter in ./shell and hit enter.  From here you can enter either wc [input] where [input] is the input for wc, cd [input] where [input] is the input for cd, or ls [input] where [input] is the input for ls but also can be left empty.

The purpose of the program:
The purpose of this program is to behave like a terminal shell and execute shell commands as they would on an actual windows, or similar, shell.
What the program does:
 

Assumptions:
